**Goal:** Become proficient in managing and optimizing PostgreSQL instances.

**Topics to Cover:**

* Roles, users, and permissions
* Backup and restore (pg\_dump, pg\_restore)
* Extensions (like `pg_stat_statements`, `PostGIS`)
* Vacuuming and analyze
* Partitioning and table inheritance
* Monitoring performance (EXPLAIN/ANALYZE, pg\_stat views)
* Connection pooling (e.g., with `pgbouncer`)

### **Phase 3: Deep Dive into Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible Server (2–3 weeks)**

**Goal:** Understand deployment, configuration, scaling, monitoring, and automation on Azure.

**Topics to Cover:**

* Architecture of Flexible Server vs. Single Server
* High availability and zone redundancy
* Performance tiers, storage, and autoscaling
* Network options: VNet integration, private endpoints
* Maintenance windows, updates, and backups

### **Phase 4: Practice, Certify, and Contribute (Ongoing)**

**Goal:** Apply your skills, pursue certification, and reinforce by teaching/sharing.

**Action Items:**

* Set up test environments in Azure with different use cases
* Migrate a sample SQL Server database to PostgreSQL on Flexible Server
* Solve real-world use cases (e.g., high availability, read replicas, cost optimization)
* Consider the [Azure Database Administrator Associate Certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-database-administrator/)
* Contribute to open-source PostgreSQL extensions or write blogs
